# CCBill Package

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MCProHosting/ccbill-node.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MCProHosting/ccbill-node)

This is a light, zero-dependency Node.js package for interacting with the CCBill API. Currently this library only supports a subset of features, but it may expand in the future.

See the "examples" folder for usage demonstrations.
